# Your Deep Learning Journey

Deep learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data—with use cases ranging from human speech recognition to animal imagery classification—by using multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to perform a specified task

Areas where we can use deep learning include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Computer Vision.
- Medicine.
- Biology.
- Image Generation.
- Recommendation Systems.
- Robotics.
- Games.
- Others.

## How to learn Deep Learning

- Teaching the whole game:
  We’ll start off by showing you how to use a complete, working, usable, state-of-the-art deep learning network to solve real-world problems using simple, expressive tools. And then we’ll gradually dig deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on…

- Always teaching through examples:
  We’ll ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation.

- Simplifying as much as possible:
  We’ve spent years building tools and teaching methods that make previously complex topics simple.

- Removing barriers:
  Deep learning has, until now, been an exclusive game. We’re breaking it open and ensuring that everyone can play.
