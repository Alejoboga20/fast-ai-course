# Your Deep Learning Journey

Deep learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data—with use cases ranging from human speech recognition to animal imagery classification—by using multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to perform a specified task

Areas where we can use deep learning include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Computer Vision.
- Medicine.
- Biology.
- Image Generation.
- Recommendation Systems.
- Robotics.
- Games.
- Others.
